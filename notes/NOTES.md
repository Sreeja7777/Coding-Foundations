Python is widely used to build software and games, analyze data and program Artificial Intelligence. You learned that:
 
🌟 humans use code to give instructions to machines
🌟 the print() instruction displays a message on the screen



🌟 Computer programs use variables to remember important information
🌟 A variable has a name and a value
🌟 You can create a variable by connecting the name and the value with an equal sign =

🌟 A piece of text is called a string
🌟 Strings require quotation marks
🌟 The print() statement is used to send a value to the screen



🌟 Numerical values can be stored in variables
🌟 You can access the value stored in a variable by calling its name
🌟 Numerical data should not be surrounded by quotation marks

🌟 You can run calculations using the values stored in variables
🌟 You can store the result of a calculation in a variable
🌟 Updating the value of a variable is called reassigning a variable

🌟 Errors in code are known as bugs
🌟 Code is executed line by line from top to bottom
🌟 Code execution is interrupted by bugs

🌟 Python is a case-sensitive language, meaning "A" and "a" are treated as different.
🌟 You can add comments to your code with the hash symbol #
🌟 Python is a case-sensitive language
🌟 Snake case is the best practice when creating multi-word variable names
🌟 A variable name can contain numbers but cannot start with a number.

🌟 Spaces are not allowed in variable names
🌟 A variable name cannot start with a number
🌟 Best practices can help you avoid errors


Input and Output in Python:


* Communication: Inputs and outputs help machines interact with the external environment.


* Input Function: input() allows users to enter values into your program.


Example: name = input("Enter your name: ") allows the user to input their name.


* Output Function: print() is used to generate outputs from your program.


Example: print("Hello, World!") outputs "Hello, World!" to the console.


Key Concept: input() for receiving user inputs and print() for producing program outputs are fundamental for interactive Python programs.


 Float is the data type for numbers with decimal places, they can be positive or negative.
 When you use the + addition operator with string values the two strings are joined together. 
This is known as concatenation.


🌟 computers store and process different data types differently
🌟 string is the data type for text
🌟 integer and float are data types for numbers


🌟 the type() instruction is used to check the data type
🌟 the division of two integers always produces a float


🌟 you can change the data type of a value with int(), float() and str()
🌟 there are implicit and explicit data type conversions in Python
🌟 str(), int(), float() instructions are explicit conversions


 
🌟 you can use explicit data type conversions to avoid bugs in your programs
🌟 int() ensures that the user input is treated as an integer number
🌟 str() can help you concatenate numbers with text


🌟 the Boolean data type has one of two possible values: True or False
🌟 a comparison operation always results in a Boolean


🌟 logical operations take multiple Boolean values as input
🌟 logical operations produce a single Boolean value as output
🌟 "and" and "or" are examples of logical operations

🌟 You can store boolean values in variables
🌟 You can store the result of logical and comparison operations in variables
🌟 You can combine operations with logical and comparison operators


🌟 You use sequencing, iteration and selection to control the flow of instructions
🌟 An algorithm is a set of step-by-step instructions to complete a task
🌟 Algorithms can be represented in different ways

🌟 you can implement iteration into your programs with the for loop
🌟 the initial loop statement must be followed by a colon : symbol
🌟 the code that gets repeated must be indented


🌟 you can apply iteration to your programs with the while loop
🌟 counters keep track of the number of iterations and avoid infinite loops
🌟 indentation and the colon : symbol are required for the code to run


🌟 for loops are used when the number of iterations is known
🌟 you can solve real problems by combining comparison operations and iterations


🌟 if-else statements are used to implement selection into your programs
🌟 the colon : symbol and the use of indentation are needed to prevent errors


🌟 You can store multiple values in a single variable with lists
🌟 Lists can contain values of different data types
🌟 Values in a list are ordered by position or index number


Remember, lists are mutable, so they can be modified after they have been created.


🌟 You can create a list with values that have been stored in variables
🌟 You can use indexing with strings
🌟 Strings are immutable


slicing a string returns another string, not a list.
🌟 You can extract a section of a sequence with slicing
🌟 Slicing a list produces another list
🌟 Slicing a string produces another string


If you leave out the end_index, like planets[2:], it means:
 "Start from index 2 and go all the way to the end of the list.”

🌟  Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks
🌟 Functions make your code more organized
🌟 Information to complete the task is passed as arguments

🌟 You can use variables as arguments for functions
🌟 A function can be an argument for another function
🌟 Some functions require specific data types as arguments

🌟 upper(), lower(), and capitalize() functions are used to change the case of a string
🌟 The find() function searches for a value in a string and returns the index of the first time it appears




🌟 Python supports "indexing from the end" (negative indexing)
🌟 The last value of a sequence has an index of -1


🌟 len() returns the number of items in a sequence
🌟 append() adds an item to the end of a list
🌟 insert() and pop() add and remove list items at specific positions


🌟 def defines a new function
🌟 The function body contains the code that is executed when the function is called
🌟 return sends values back so they can be stored and used in the program


🌟 A function can return multiple values
🌟 Defining a function also decides the data types it can take in, handle and return
🌟 Default values make arguments optional


HTML will allow you to:
Create websites
Work more effectively with technical teams
Improve digital marketing skills




⭐ HTML code controls the structure of a web page
⭐ HTML tags are used to add elements to a web page
⭐ Some examples of HTML tags are <button>, <img>, <table> and <p>


 
⭐ Elements like buttons and paragraph text require container tags
⭐ Container tags consist of both opening < > and closing </> tags
⭐ You can use the Code Playground to write, run and test real HTML code




⭐ There are many advantages of using headings in your pages
⭐ You can use up to 6 levels of headings
⭐ Headings require container tags

⭐ Comments make your code easier to read and understand
⭐ The <!--...--> tag allows you to add comments to your code
⭐ The <br> tag is used to create line breaks

⭐ HTML documents can be organized into head and body
​​⭐ The <body> tag ensures compatibility with all browsers
⭐ Indentation helps with readability and therefore collaboration 
⭐ You can use nesting to make the text bold, italic and underlined with the <b>, <i> and <u> formatting tags
⭐ You can make your web pages more accessible with the use of <strong> and <em> semantic formatting tags









The source (src) in the image tag points to the server where the image can be found.


⭐ Images can be linked or embedded in web pages
⭐ Images don’t require closing tags
⭐ The source (url) of the image is needed for the image to be found on the internet
